        <p>By placing an order with Sweet Adventures Club, you agree to the following terms and conditions:</p>
        <p>1. All orders are made to order and must be paid in full before production begins. We do not start preparing an order until payment is received.</p>
        <p>2. We only deliver within San Mateo County, CA. Delivery details, including time and location, will be confirmed upon order placement.</p>
        <p>3. Due to the perishable nature of our cheesecakes, all sales are final. We do not accept returns, refunds, or exchanges once an order has been fulfilled.</p>
        <p>4. Order availability is subject to our production schedule. We recommend placing orders in advance to secure your preferred date.</p>
        <p>5. Product descriptions, pricing, and availability are subject to change without notice. While we strive to provide accurate information, we do not guarantee that all details are always up to date.</p>
        <p>6. We reserve the right to update these terms at any time. Continued use of our website and services constitutes acceptance of any changes.</p>
        <p>7. If you have any questions about these Terms and Conditions, deliveries, or wholesale inquiries, please contact us at [insert contact information].</p>
