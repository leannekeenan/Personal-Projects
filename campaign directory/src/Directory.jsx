  { id: 1, name: "Kyu Osmodius Underwood Gailwind Higglsbee", image: KyuImage, title:"Inventor / Team Quartermaster", description: ["Kyu is the party quartermaster and inventor. Kyu grew up among the resilient and fiercely proud artisans of Arrogan, a city-state where craftsmanship is revered as the highest form of expression. As a dwarf from Arrogan, Kyu's early life was rooted in tradition, working tirelessly to hone his skills in forging, building, and crafting. But Kyu’s curiosity extended beyond physical creation; he was drawn to the allure of knowledge itself, which led him to Adoreon’s archives. There, he became an Archivist, poring over volumes of texts, maps, and forgotten lore that deepened his knowledge of ancient mechanisms, arcane relics, and powerful artifacts. Years later, Kyu was recruited by the Apathian government to join an elite team as the quartermaster, overseeing supplies, logistics, and the equipment that would keep his party running. His background as an archivist gave him an edge, allowing him to recognize useful relics and their potential tactical applications, while his Arrogan roots made him a keen judge of quality and durability. Part-time inventor and skilled in retrofitting and improving equipment, Kyu tinkers with gear, adapting it for use in unexpected situations. His gruff humor and meticulous eye for detail make him both the party’s invaluable support and a stalwart ally, keeping them outfitted, informed, and always a step ahead in the field."]},

  { id: 4, name: "Carri Letters", image: CarriLetters, title:"", description: "arri Letters is a seasoned messenger for the Apathian government, known for her sharp wit and unrivaled efficiency. She has spent years navigating the intricacies of Apathian bureaucracy, learning to thrive in the sluggish, politically charged environment where others might falter. Raised in Apathe but born in Irateia, Carri was the younger of two sisters growing up amid military pride and political unrest. While her sister, Scarlet, leaned into rebellion, eventually becoming a rogue pirate of the Indullian coasts, Carri chose a quieter, more calculated path. What few know is that Carri was recruited as a teenager into I.R.I.S.—the Iratian Reconnaissance and Intelligence Syndicate—a covert order of spies embedded across Sevynashyuns to protect Iratian interests from within. As a junior operative, she trained in intelligence gathering, infiltration, and coded communication. She still bears the symbol of I.R.I.S.—a delicate iris flower tattoo hidden behind her ear—a reminder of her true allegiance and the weight of the secrets she carries. Her transition to the Apathian bureaucracy was not a demotion but a mission. Disguised as a humble courier, Carri quickly rose through the ranks, becoming invaluable for her impeccable memory, attention to detail, and unrivaled discretion. Her role made her privy to some of the most sensitive information exchanged between the city-states: political secrets, diplomatic threats, and intelligence that could reshape alliances. Her insight and connections now rival those of the highest-ranking officials." },

  { id: 7, name: "Paige Turner", image: PaigeTurnner, title:"", description: "Paige Turner grew up amid the vibrant intellectual circles of Adoreon, where their natural curiosity and affinity for the arcane led them to a position as an Arcane Research Assistant. In this role, Paige honed a meticulous approach to studying ancient spells and artifacts, often working late into the night, deciphering complex texts, and testing obscure incantations. Paige’s growing knowledge eventually attracted the attention of Apathian scholars, and they were offered a coveted position in Apathe as an Academic Librarian—an opportunity to broaden their horizons and delve even deeper into magical lore. Now in the heart of Apathian scholarship, Paige finds themselves surrounded by volumes of forbidden knowledge, lost magic, and forgotten histories. Their journey from Adoreon’s lively arcane labs to the quiet, candle-lit corners of Apathe’s restricted libraries has imbued them with both a love for magic and a quiet intensity. Paige’s warlock abilities, honed through years of study and practice, are often employed not in battle, but in pursuit of forgotten spells and the mysteries they’ve sworn to protect." },

  { id: 16, name: "Rick O'Shea", image: RickOShea, title:"", description: "Rick O’Shea grew up in the bustling trade district of Arrogan, where words could be as sharp as blades and deals were struck with a firm handshake—or a subtle sleight of hand. Raised among merchants, diplomats, and skilled laborers, Rick quickly learned that a well-placed word could open more doors than brute force. But he also knew that sometimes, a steady hand and quick reflexes were necessary to keep those doors from slamming shut. As a young dwarf, Rick honed his skills as both a negotiator and an enforcer, working as a bodyguard for traveling dignitaries and high-profile clients. His ability to disarm tensions—or just disarm opponents—earned him a reputation as a man who could talk his way out of anything or fight his way through it if needed. It wasn’t long before his talents caught the attention of Apathe’s security division, where he was recruited as a Security Liaison, ensuring that high-stakes meetings remained civil and that no one left with more holes than they arrived with. Rick is charming, fast-talking, and always five steps ahead of a conversation. He navigates bureaucracies with ease, but his street smarts and combat instincts keep him grounded. Whether he’s intercepting an assassin mid-strike, confiscating contraband with a knowing smirk, or appearing at just the right moment to save an old friend, Rick O’Shea is the kind of ally you want when things go south." },

They uses non-lethal methods to incapacitate or disarm enemies, often with their psychic powers rather than physical force. Zhenk’tal's telepathy and control over psychic energy allow them to subdue rather than kill, ensuring that anyone who challenges them will lose with minimal harm. Their legendary resistance and psionic defense abilities ensure that the party cannot easily defeat them through conventional means. Their telekinetic and psychic powers make them a formidable opponent that the party will realize quickly is far beyond their capabilities. Even in combat, Zhenk'tal avoids direct aggression, preferring to disable or disarm those who pose a threat, keeping the peace while ensuring the party understands that their role as protector and guide is not to be challenged lightly." },
